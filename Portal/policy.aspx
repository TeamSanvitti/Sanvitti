          </span>
          <p>While visiting our websites, we may ask that you provide personal information (name, email address, postal address, etc.). For example, we may request certain personal information when you set up an account online, purchase products, participate in a sweepstakes, promotion or survey, contact LAN Gloal with a question or concern, apply for employment with LAN Gloal, or participate in other activities. If you are placing an order on an LAN Gloal website, you may be required to provide billing or shipping information (credit card number, shipping address, etc.). When submitting personal information in an online form, we will identify which fields are required in order to fulfill your request. Additionally, our web servers automatically collect click-stream information such as the address or URL of the website that you came from before visiting our site, which pages you visit on our site, which browser you used to view our site and any search terms you may have entered in a search engine to find our site.</p>
          <p>We use the information you provide in order to: fulfill requests for products, services or information; provide customer services; administer sweepstakes or promotions; offer new products and services; measure and improve the effectiveness of our websites, our marketing endeavors or our services and offers; tailor our online offerings to your preferences; administer surveys; send marketing communications; or other business purposes.</p>
          <p class="copyblue">Does LAN Gloal use cookies or other technologies to collect information?</p>
          <p>Certain LAN Gloal websites utilize cookies. Cookies are small data files that a website may send to your browser and which may then be stored on your hard drive. Some of our website uses cookies to simulate a continuous connection -- cookies let us &quot;remember&quot; information about your preferences and session, and allow you to move within areas of our websites without reintroducing yourself. No personally identifiable information is stored in these cookies.</p>
          <p>Our websites may also use other technologies to track which pages visitors view on our websites. This non-identifiable click-stream data helps us understand how visitors use our websites.</p>
          <p class="copyblue">Does LAN Gloal share the information I've provided?</p>
          <p>LAN Gloal may need to share personal information with third parties in certain circumstances. For example, we may release personal information to third parties to perform services on our behalf such as: sending marketing communications for LAN Gloal, conducting research or surveys, or sending regular mail or email on behalf of LAN Gloal.</p>
          <p>Any information you provide to us may be combined or shared between current or future LAN Gloal entities and subsidiaries.</p>
          <p>From time to time, we may be required to provide personal information in response to a valid court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful. We may release certain personal information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves. We may also release personal information in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event.</p>
          <p class="copyblue">How does LAN Gloal secure my personal information?</p>
          <p>We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, unauthorized access and alteration of the information under our control.</p>
          <p>Because credit card security is a high priority, we have taken steps to ensure that payment information is processed confidentially, accurately and securely. LAN Gloal websites use encryption technology, such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), to protect your credit card information during processing. SSL encrypts ordering information such as your name, address, and credit card number.</p>
          <p>Although we cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction of data, we take reasonable precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences. LAN Gloal cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us by email and you do so at your own risk.</p>
          <p class="copyblue">Will this privacy policy change?</p>
          <p>Because our websites and businesses will continue to implement new technologies and improve the services and features we provide, this Privacy Policy is subject to change. If there are changes or additions to this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes here or in other formats we deem acceptable, so that you will always know what information we collect and how we use it. If we change our information practices or this Privacy Policy in such a way that your personal information may be used or shared in a different manner, we will give you the opportunity to opt-out of having your information used or shared in that new manner. </p>          </td>
